Move things over into a Util object

Has.js? http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#hasjs

For build flags: set in require.js

Building / testing with Require.js
Grunt compilation into standalone form with require.js's wrap, probably with almond?
  'mangle' off for the standalone/development versions
  Wrap outside of almond
  Looks like we need to use the require.js optimizer to do the minification (hybrid?), wrapping, source map, etc. to do it right.
    See https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js
  Different targets for debug and release, instead of the 'hardcoded' way right now.
  API export
  Source maps
  Line length limit for minified version?
  How to handle / inline images
Unit tests and linting - create HTML as standard for QUnit and JSHint a la Scenery, but also have it hookable into the build process


Move 'common' functions out or just refactor in so we stay without dependencies
Output SVGMatrix easily
Add mutable style, and possibly a flag to see whether something has been modified?
Investigate math library alternatives, like Numeric JS
