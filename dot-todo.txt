Building / testing with Require.js
Grunt compilation into standalone form with require.js's wrap, probably with almond?
  Different targets for debug and release, instead of the 'hardcoded' way right now.
  API export
  Source maps
  Line length limit for minified version?
Unit tests and linting - create HTML as standard for QUnit and JSHint a la Scenery, but also have it hookable into the build process


Move 'common' functions out or just refactor in so we stay without dependencies
Output SVGMatrix easily
Add mutable style, and possibly a flag to see whether something has been modified?
Investigate math library alternatives, like Numeric JS
