Check for performance loss on Vector2 by using this.constructor instead of Vector2

Bugs:

Add:
  Robust root finding for higher-order polynomials
  makeImmutable()?
  integration with Numeric JS for relevant calls?

Cleanup:
  Matrix4 should match Matrix3

Move over more of phetcommon's math

Building / testing with Require.js
Grunt compilation into standalone form with require.js's wrap, probably with almond?
  'mangle' off for the standalone/development versions
  Wrap outside of almond
  Looks like we need to use the require.js optimizer to do the minification (hybrid?), wrapping, source map, etc. to do it right.
    See https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js
  Source maps
  Line length limit for minified version?
  How to handle / inline images

Investigate math library alternatives, like Numeric JS

Low priority:
  Linting in unit tests -- pull info from Gruntfile.js (or another source) and somehow get a file listing
